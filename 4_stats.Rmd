# Statistical analysis in metabolomics

For most metabolomics studies, one or more of the following approaches at statistically interpreting the data will be used:

* Univariate statistics - where each feature is assessed independently (e.g., t-test).
* Multivariate (unsupervised) - where features are assessed together and without the use of training data (e.g., PCA)
* Multivariate (supervised) - where features are assessed together and with the use of labelled training data (e.g., PLS-DA)

In this tutorial we will first use unsupervised multivariate analysis (principal component analysis - “PCA”) to assess intensity data and then use univariate analysis (t-tests) to assess the diﬀerentially abundant molecules among chemical treatment samples compared to the control for each experimental condition.


# PCA of intensity

PCA is an unsupervised multivariate statistical approach that is used throughout the analysis of the metabolomics data. It transforms the high dimensionality of 1000s of features to be viewed by a smaller number of ‘principal components’ that still contain most of the information within the complete set. These principal components are new variables constructed from linear combinations of the initial features where the first few principal components have the maximum amount of explained variation.

PCA has multiple applications (e.g., to assess data quality), to identify outliers, and to check each step in the data processing (all of which was done with this dataset by Phenome Centre Birmingham and used directly in the interpretation of the biological activity).

Here, we will be looking at data that has already been checked for data quality (including QC samples and outlier samples), and we are now assessing what we believe is valid bioactivity.


```{r root_dir_url, echo=FALSE}
root <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michabohealthscience/training-fsa/main'
```


```{r root_dir, echo=FALSE}
root <- '.'
```



```{r hilic_pos_glog}
# Read in the sample metadata and processed data matrix
sample_metadata <- read.csv(file.path(root, 'data/HILIC_POS_male/0_sample_metadata_filtered.csv'))
glog <- read.csv(file.path(root, 'data/HILIC_POS_male/5_glog.csv'), row.names = 1)


```

The PCA function within R `prcomp` needs to have the samples as rows and the features as columns. So next, we need to transpose the data.


```{r hilic_pos_glog_transpose}
# transpose 
glog_t <- t(glog)

```

Now, let’s remove the QC samples, as they have already been used for the quality assessments and are no longer required.

```{r hilic_pos_glog_qc_remove}
qc_names <- sample_metadata[,1][sample_metadata$Class=='QC']
sample_metadata_no_qcs <- sample_metadata[sample_metadata$Class!='QC',]

glog_t_no_qcs <- glog_t[!rownames(glog_t) %in% qc_names,]

```

OK… finally we are ready to perform the PCA.

```{r hilic_pos_glog_pca}
pca_no_qcs <- prcomp(glog_t_no_qcs, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)
```

We can plot the results by using the `ggfortify` function, which automatically knows what to plot for PCA outputs from `prcomp`.

```{r hilic_pos_glog_pca_plot}
library(ggfortify)
# the x and y variable can be adjusted to show compare different principal components

autoplot(pca_no_qcs, x=1, y=2, data=sample_metadata_no_qcs, colour="test_substance",  shape="dose_group", frame=TRUE, frame.colour = 'test_substance')+
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("khaki","black","blue", 'red', "grey",'orange', 'magenta', 'yellow', 'green', 'brown', 'purple'))+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("khaki","black","blue", 'red', "grey",'orange', 'magenta', 'yellow', 'green', 'brown', 'purple'))+
  scale_shape_manual(values=c(4,8,2))+
  theme_bw()

```


> Whilst the above is useful and we can see groups emerging - we are interested in how similar each test substance treatment is compared to the control. So let’s look at that in more detail


# Student t-test

Here, we will employ a commonly used univariate (two-tailed) statistical test for significant differences observed between the mean intensity value of a feature when comparing treated samples versus control conditions.

There are two key metrics we will be using:

* **t-statistic (or t-value)**
* **p-value**

![](t-test.png)

&nbsp;


We will be using the probabilistic quotient normalization (PQN) intensity matrix for this analysis (so missing value imputation and glog have not been applied to the matrix).


```{r t-test_data}
pqn <- read.csv(file.path(root, 'data/HILIC_POS_male/3_pqn.csv'))

```

Let’s start with doing a single t-test for one feature under one experimental condition versus control.

```{r t-test_data_one_feature}
# Get all the control samples (i.e. all those with dose 0)
control_samples <- sample_metadata[,1][sample_metadata$dose_group==0]

# Get the high dose group (2) for test substance 1
ts1_dose_2_samples <- sample_metadata[,1][sample_metadata$dose_group==2 & sample_metadata$test_substance==1]

# Select the 2000th feature as an example
f2000 <- pqn[2000,]


controldf <- data.frame(intensity = unlist(f2000[,control_samples]), control_treated = 'control')

treateddf <- data.frame(intensity = unlist(f2000[,ts1_dose_2_samples]), control_treated = 'treated')

# Perform a t-test for this feature subset based on the chosen samples
ttest_out <- t.test(treateddf$intensity, controldf$intensity)

ttest_out

```

Based on this result, we can conclude that the means for the treated samples versus control samples are significantly diﬀerent from one another for this feature. This diﬀerence is made obvious by visualising the data as well.


```{r boxplot_data_one_feature}

ctdf <- rbind(controldf, treateddf)
mean_values <- aggregate(ctdf$intensity, by = list(ctdf$control_treated), FUN = mean)
boxplot(intensity ~ control_treated, data = ctdf, frame = FALSE,  main=f2000['feature_name'])


```



We can run multiple t-test in a function to conduct the t-test for all features for a specific test substance treatment. Moreover, we can also calculate the fold change diﬀerence between the control and treated means.


> **NOTE** - a function to do this is provided in the [**More info**](6_more_info.html) tab. If you already have some experience with R, feel free to run yourself otherwise just load in the output below. 


See below for a data frame of all the t-stats, p-values and fold changes calculated for test substance 2 (TS2).


```{r load_in_all_ttest_ts2}
ttest_ts2 <- read.csv(file.path(root, 'data/ttest_ts2.csv'))
```

Let's have a quick check of this dataframe. 
```{r check_result_p}
sum(ttest_ts2$pvalue<0.05)
```

Multiple testing correction is recommended when performing multiple t-tests to reduce the false positive results.

Let’s use the the `p.adjust` function to calculate adjusted p-values (i.e., q-values) with the fdr
method (i.e., the Benjamini & Hochberg approach).



```{r check_result_q}
ttest_ts2$qvalue <- p.adjust(ttest_ts2$pvalue, method = 'fdr')
sum(ttest_ts2$qvalue<0.05)
```

So, for this test substance we know we have many metabolite features changing significantly in their average abundance.

Let’s visualise these results using a volcano plot to give a better idea of the number and the magnitude of differentially abundant metabolites that are increasing or decreasing in abundance in response to the chemical treatment at the two different doses used.



```{r multiple_testing_correction}


ttest_ts2$diff <- 'NONE'
ttest_ts2$diff[ttest_ts2$tstat<0 & ttest_ts2$qvalue<0.05] <- 'DOWN'
ttest_ts2$diff[ttest_ts2$tstat>0 & ttest_ts2$qvalue<0.05] <- 'UP'


ggplot(data=ttest_ts2, aes(x=log2(fc), y=-log10(qvalue), col=diff)) +
        geom_point() + 
        theme_minimal() +
        scale_color_manual(values=c("blue", "black", "red")) +
        geom_vline(xintercept=c(-0.6, 0.6), col="red") +
        geom_hline(yintercept=-log10(0.05), col="red") +
        facet_grid(cols = vars(dose))+
        theme(legend.position="bottom")



```

# Summary of t-tests
What about all the other test substances and other assays?

Rather than repeating this exercise for all the test substances and assays in this training, we have a data file already created with the relevant t-stats that we can use for grouping in the next section.

Below, we show a summary of all the t-test analyses done across all assays.

This was used as a manual check to see if any of the test substance treatments were not exhibiting appropriate bioactivity, and a decision was made on whether to include these treatments in the grouping analysis.

Following a review of the data, it was deemed that, for the male component, there was suﬃcient bioactivity to proceed with grouping without removing any test substance treatments. For the female data, however, treatment groups were removed.
